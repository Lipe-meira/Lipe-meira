## Hi there ✌️

I'm Felipe, a Computer Science student in my 5th semester, based in Brazil.

I’m passionate about building elegant systems and using technology to make a positive impact.

Currently, I’m learning React and Spring Boot to develop full-stack web applications. I’ve also started studying through MIT OpenCourseWare to deepen my knowledge.

I’m now looking for job opportunities where I can work on real-world projects and continue improving my skills.

## Fun Facts
- I play CS2 every week — I already have almost 2.5k hours 😂
- I don’t like coffee or tea 🫠
- I enjoy understanding how systems work under the hood.
- I love read books
